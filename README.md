# Painting Classification

Paintings have been historically classified according to their art style (based on period, school or movement) and over the rich history of visual art over the last few centuries, dozens of such styles have emerged from across the world. However, this can be overwhelming for the layperson interested in learning more about a particular painting or the field in general. A classification tool can help them to learn the artist or style of a painting they like and continue their engagement with art. Hence, it can be used as a tool to promote public education and awareness of art. In more practical terms, the tool in a more developed form can be used by art professionals, such as art dealers and appraisers, to help automate or double check painting processing and fraud detection. 

## Data Source
Several institutions have recently made available images of historical paintings available for public viewing and downloading on their websites. WikiArt is one the earliest and largest databases. However, gathering these images would require scraping these websites. The Kaggle competition Painter- by-Numbers (https://www.kaggle.com/c/painter-by-numbers), carried out this activity from WikiArt and compiled into a large dataset of 103,250 unique images (about 37 GB in size). Each image is available in jpeg format in widely varying sizes and resolutions (all color). Also included is a csv file listing each image with file name, title, artist, style, genre, pixels and date.  

## Preprocessing and EDA
Details are in provided file ‘Capstone_EDA.ipynb’. The primary route of interacting with the data structure was through the csv file containing all the image metadata. Several of the columns, particularly for date and genre, had null values. For the two main classification targets, style and artist, rows containing null values in the corresponding column were removed (a small portion of total rows). This was done separately for each target, as different rows had different null columns. 
Next, rows with excessively large pixel resolution or file size were also discarded. Finally, the distribution of unique classes and their image count was plotted. First for style, there were 136 unique styles present (Figure 1). However, over half of these had very few example images less than 500 in number. Image classification learning typically is said to require in the thousands for good learning and can be quite computationally taxing. Furthermore, a large number of classes makes modelling difficult. Therefore, it was decided that only the top 20 categories in terms of example images available would be modelled for classification. This resulted in the 20 styles shown in Figure 2. 
As can be seen, there is still a great deal of imbalance, but it is not practical to utilize thousands of images for the more numerous classes. Therefore, an equal number of images was randomly drawn from each style, thus removing imbalance issues as well as computational practicality ones. Beyond this, as the raw data was in form of pixel values for each image, not much preprocessing or data wrangling was possible other than resizing of the images (all were resized to equal square dimensions of at first 224x224 and then 320x320). A further filter issue was images with extreme dimension ratios (very long
